Name: Ambioris Lora
Assignment: 8(scrabble)

What Works: 
	1. I believe everything that is listed in the rubric is in my submission. 
	2. It does the basic things like read the letter that was dropped, track the score of the letter and the graphics themselves are draggable.
	3. It even does everything listed in the additional section like return if not dropped on a droppable and restricts the droppable to prevent spaces in the word
What probably works
	1. I was able to test the amount aspect of json object to prevent going over the amount of tiles but i wasnt able to indepth test it.
what doesnt work
	1. I ran out of time to implement the dictionary check.
